#Thingadoo

This Java desktop app was designed to help people find exciting new activities around them to do and share on a Friday night, or gain familiarity and excitement when visiting a new location.

To run the file, first start MySQL, and add the .sql file in. Run the script, removing the first line ("DROP DATABASE") for the first time.

Then, run the MainClient class, which has a main function.

This project was done along with 3 team members, Sam Picus, Alana Kahamele-Sanfratello, and Erik Byargeon.
