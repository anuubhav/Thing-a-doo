#Thingadoo

This desktop Java app was designed to help people find exciting new activities around them to do and share on a Friday night, or gain familiarity and excitement when visiting a new location.

This project was done along with 3 team members, Sam Picus, Alana Kahamele-Sanfratello, and Erik Byargeon.
